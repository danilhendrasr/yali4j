# YALIJA

## What is it?
YALIJA stands for Yet Another Lox Interpreter written in Java. Initially I wanted to claim that it's "a new programming language written in Java" because it sounds cooler :p, but unfortunately it's not a new language because I don't design the grammars and such, I'm just coding up the interpreter.

Though creating a new programming language by extending this interpreter is definitely on my mind.

Because it's written in Java, it runs on JVM.

## What kind of interpreter is this going to be?
It will be a tree-walk interpreter, no compilation step, no bytecode generation, let alone machine code generation or any similar fancy stuff.
<br> It will be slow performance-wise, but it's a great start for learning.

## Current Status
- [x] Scanner

## Notes
All works are done in the [dev](https://github.com/danilhendrasr/yalija/tree/dev) branch. The `main` branch will only be used to tag releases.
