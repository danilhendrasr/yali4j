# YALIJA

## What is it?
YALIJA stands for Yet Another Lox Interpretter written in Java. Initially I wanted to claim that it's "a new programming language written in Java" because it sounds cooler :p, but unfortunately it's not a new language because I don't design the grammars and such, I'm just coding up the interpreter.
Though creating a new programming language by extending this interpreter is definitely on my mind.

## Notes
All works are done the [dev](https://github.com/danilhendrasr/yalija/tree/dev) branch. The `main` branch will only be used to tag releases.
