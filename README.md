# YALIJA

## What is it?
YALIJA stands for Yet Another Lox Interpreter written in Java. Initially I wanted to claim that it's "a new programming language written in Java" because it sounds cooler :p, but unfortunately it's not, I don't design the grammars and such, I'm just coding up the interpreter.

Though creating a new programming language by extending this interpreter is definitely on my mind.

It runs on JVM... I mean, obviously.

## What kind of interpreter is this going to be?
It will be a tree-walk interpreter, no compilation step, no bytecode generation, let alone machine code generation or any similar fancy stuff.
<br> It will be slow performance-wise, but it's a great start for learning.

## Current Status
- [x] Scanner
- [ ] Parser
- [ ] Core interpreter

## I Never Heard of Lox
That's to be expected, Lox language is a language described in Bob Nystrom's book, [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/). It's just language that is created for learning purpose, not a programming language that is used in real world like Java or Python.
