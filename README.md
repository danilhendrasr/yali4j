# YALIJA

YALIJA stands for Yet Another Lox Interpretter written in Java. Initially I wanted to claim that it's "a new programming language written in Java" because it sounds cooler :p, but unfortunately I can't, it's not a new language because I don't design the grammars and such, I just code up the interpreter.
Though creating a new programming language by extending this interpreter is definitely on my mind.
